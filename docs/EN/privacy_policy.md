### 1. **Introduction**  
This Privacy Policy describes how the **butterBror** bot (hereinafter referred to as the "Bot") collects, uses, and protects user data on Twitch, Discord, and Telegram platforms. The Bot aims to minimize the collection of personal data and adhere to principles of transparency.  

---

### 2. **Data Collected**  
#### **Publicly Available Data:**  
The Bot automatically receives and processes the following information accessible through public APIs of the platforms:  
- Streamer name, channel ID, viewer usernames.  
- Chat messages, commands, and user activity in the channel.  
- Stream status (online/offline) and viewer count.  

This data is necessary for the Bot’s core functions (e.g., moderation, games, notifications). It is not considered confidential as it is publicly accessible via official platform interfaces.  

#### **User’s Residential City (Exception):**  
If you provide your city information (e.g., via the `_location set` command or profile), it is stored for personalization purposes (e.g., weather forecasts). The city **is not linked to your real name or IP address** unless explicitly provided voluntarily.  

---

### 3. **How Data Is Used**  
- **Bot Functionality:**  
  Public data is processed to execute commands (e.g., moderation, giveaways, timers).  
- **Personalization:**  
  Residential city data provides localized information (weather, time zone).  
- **Analysis and Improvement:**  
  Aggregated statistics (e.g., command frequency) may optimize the Bot’s performance.  

---

### 4. **Data Sharing**  
- **No information is shared with third parties**, except:  
  - Platforms (Twitch, Discord, Telegram) per their API policies.  
  - Law enforcement or judicial authorities upon lawful request.  
- **User data is never sold or monetized.**  

---

### 5. **User Rights**  
You may:  
- **Access** data linked to your account (e.g., residential city).  
- **Request deletion** of your data via support channels.  
- **Revoke consent** for city data collection by sending the `_location clear` command.  

---

### 6. **Data Security**  
- Data is encrypted during transmission (HTTPS/SSL).  
- Residential city data is stored in a restricted-access database.  
- Sensitive information (e.g., passwords, payment details, phone numbers) is not collected.  

---

### 7. **Children and Age Restrictions**  
The Bot is not intended for users under 13 years old. If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child has provided data, contact us for removal.  

---

### 8. **Policy Changes**  
Updates to this policy will be published here and in the Bot’s **[Twitch chat](https://twitch.tv/buttebror)**. Continued use constitutes acceptance of revised terms.
